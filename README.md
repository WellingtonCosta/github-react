# github-react

A simple React application that consumes GitHub API. This project also uses [Material UI][1] for UI components, [axios][1] to do http requests, [redux][2] for app state management, [redux-saga][3] to deal with side-effects and [reach-router][4] to create app routes.

This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app][5].
